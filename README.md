The goal is to investigate the potential of the Nintendo Wii Balance Board as an alternative device to force plates for postural steadiness measurements.

Previous studies focusing on time domain measures derived from the Center Of Pressure (COP) displacement have already been done in order to validate the reliability of the device.

My work is aiming at validating COP-based measurements both in the time and frequency domains.
